	   <p class="paragraph">SQL is Structured Query Language, which
	   is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving
	   data stored in a relational database.</p>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System. 
	   All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL,
	   MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use 
	   SQL as their standard database language.</p>
	   
	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">SQL is a short-form of the structured query language,
	   and it is pronounced as S-Q-L or sometimes as See-Quell.</p>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">This database language is mainly designed
	   for maintaining the data in relational database management systems. 
	   It is a special tool used by data professionals for handling
	   structured data (data which is stored in the form of tables).
	   It is also designed for stream processing in RDSMS.</p>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">You can easily create and manipulate the database,
	   access and modify the table rows and columns, etc. 
	   This query language became the standard of ANSI in
	   the year of 1986 and ISO in the year of 1987.</p>

       <p class="paragraph">If you want to get a job in the field of data science, 
	   then it is the most important query language to learn. Big enterprises like
	   Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, use SQL for storing the data in the back-end.</p>
	   
	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>Why SQL?</h2>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">Nowadays, SQL is widely used in data science and analytics.
	   Following are the reasons which explain why it is widely used:</p>
	   
	   <ul class="points">
	   
	     <li>The basic use of SQL for data professionals and SQL users is to insert, update,
		 and delete the data from the relational database.
		 </li>
		 
	     <li>SQL allows the data professionals and users to retrieve the 
		 data from the relational database management systems.
		 </li>
		 
	     <li>It also helps them to describe the structured data.</li>
		 
	     <li>It allows SQL users to create, drop, and manipulate the database and its tables.</li>
		 
	     <li>It also helps in creating the view, stored procedure,
		 and functions in the relational database.</li>
		 
	   </ul>
	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>History of SQL</h2>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">
       "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" was a paper which was published by 
	   the great computer scientist "E.F. Codd" in 1970.</p>

       <p class="paragraph">The IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin originally developed the SEQUEL 
	   (Structured English Query Language) after learning from the paper given by E.F. Codd.
	   They both developed the SQL at the San Jose Research laboratory of IBM Corporation in 1970.</p>

       <p class="paragraph">At the end of the 1970s, relational software Inc. developed their own first SQL using 
	   the concepts of E.F. Codd, Raymond Boyce, and Donald Chamberlin. This SQL was totally based 
	   on RDBMS. Relational Software Inc., which is now known as Oracle Corporation, introduced the
	   Oracle V2 in June 1979, which is the first implementation of SQL language. This Oracle V2 version 
	   operates on VAX computers.</p>
	   
	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>Some SQL Commands</h2>
	   <p class="paragraph">The SQL commands help 
	   in creating and managing the database. The most common
	   SQL commands which are highly used are mentioned below:<p>
	   

	    <ul  class="points">
		
	     <li>CREATE command</li>
		 
		 <li>UPDATE command</li>
		 
		 <li>DELETE command</li>
		 
		 <li>SELECT command</li>
		 
	   </ul>
	   
	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>CREATE Command</h2>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">This command helps in creating the new
	   database, new table, table view, and other objects of the database.</p>
	   
	   <hr>
	   	   <h2>UPDATE  Command</h2>

	   <p class="paragraph">This command helps in
	   updating or changing the stored data in the database.</p>

         <hr>
		 
       <h2>DELETE Command</h2>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">This command helps in removing or erasing
	   the saved records from the database tables. It erases single
	   or multiple tuples from the tables of the database.</p>
	   
	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>SELECT Command</h2>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">This command helps in accessing the single or
	   multiple rows from one or multiple tables of the database. We can also use 
	   this command with the WHERE clause.</p>

	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>Applications of SQL</h2>
	   <p class="paragraph">As mentioned before, SQL is one of the most widely used query language over the databases.
	   I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
	   
	   <ul  class="points">
	   
	     <li>Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.
	     </li>
		 
	     <li>Allows users to describe the data.
		 </li>
		 
	     <li>Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.
		 </li>
		 
	     <li>Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.
		 </li>
		 
	   <li>Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.
	   </li>
	   
	   <li>Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.
	   </li>
	   
	   <li>Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.
	   </li>
	   
	   
	   </ul>

	   <h2>Audience</h2>
	  <p class="paragraph">This SQL tutorial is prepared for beginners to help
	  them understand the basic concepts related to SQL
	  languages. This tutorial will give you enough understanding on the various
	  components of SQL along with suitable examples.</p> 
	  
	  <hr>
	   
	   <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">Before you start practicing with various
	   types of examples given in this tutorial, I am assuming that 
	   you are already aware about what a database is, especially 
	   the RDBMS and what is a computer programming language.</p>
