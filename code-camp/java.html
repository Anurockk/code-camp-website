	   <p class="paragraph">Java is a high-level programming language originally
	   developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety 
	   of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. 
	   This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This reference will
	   take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Java Programming language.</p>
	   
	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>Why to Learn java Programming?</h2>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">Java is a MUST for students and working professionals
	   to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in 
	   Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages
	   of learning Java Programming:</p>
	   
	   <ul class="points">
	     <li><b>Object Oriented</b>:- In Java, everything is an Object.
		 Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
		 </li>
		 
	     <li><b>Platform Independent</b>:- Unlike many other programming languages
		 including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform
		 specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code
		 is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on
		 whichever platform it is being run on.
		 </li>
		 
	     <li><b>Simple</b>Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand
		 the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
		 </li>
		 
	     <li><b>Secure</b>:- With Java's secure feature it enables to
		 develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques
		 are based on public-key encryption.
		 </li>
		 
	     <li><b>Architecture-neutral</b>:- Java compiler generates an 
		 architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the
		 compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.</li>
		 
	   </ul>
	   
	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>Hello World using Java Programming.</h2>
	   
	   <pre>
    public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

   /* This is my first java program.
    * This will print
	'Hello World' as the output
    */

   public static void main(String []args)
   {
   System.out.println("Hello World"); 
   // prints Hello World
   }
}

	   </pre>
	   
	   <hr>
	   
	   <h2>Applications of Java Programming</h2>
	   
	   <p class="paragraph">The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8.
	   With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations
	   were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications,
	   J2ME for Mobile Applications.
       <p>

	   <p class="paragraph">The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. 
	   Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.</p>
	   
	   <ul  class="points">
	   
	     <li><b>Multithreaded</b>:- With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible
		 to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously.
		 This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive
		 applications that can run smoothly.</li>
		 
		 <li><b>Interpreted </b>:-  Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and
		 is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical
		 since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.</li>
		 
		 <li><b>High Performance</b>:- With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.
		 </li>
		 
		 <li><b>Dynamic</b>:- Java is considered to be more dynamic than
		 C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment.
		 Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that
		 can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.
		 </li>
		 
	   </ul>
